## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

This project **does not include the `ConnectionFactory.java` file** (used for database connection in `com.dao`) in the repository **for privacy and security reasons**.

‚û°Ô∏è **You must create your own database connection file** using JDBC.  
Here‚Äôs an example structure:

```java
package com.dao;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;

public class ConnectionFactory {
    public static Connection getConnection() throws Exception {
        Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
        return DriverManager.getConnection(
            "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db_name", "your_username", "your_password"
        );
    }
}
